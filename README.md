# samuel-chess
- Samuel chess is a father-son driven project where we build chess in ruby as dragon riders.
- After basic chess has been completed we will be adding +Â½ chess, +1 chess, multichess and other strange chess variants we made up.
## To play or develop
- Get dragonruby and point the run.bat to it
